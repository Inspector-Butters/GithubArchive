# Github Archive
Create a verifiable archive of GithHub repositories on decentralized storage. The reasons why this is important is that GithHub is a centralized service that can at anytime decide not to offer their services anymore or easily censor repositories. having a decentralized archive of the repository states would be beneficial for this purpose.

The verification is done using Lit Protocol nodes.

This project was created at HackFS 2024.
